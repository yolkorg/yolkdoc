## Joining
This is obviously what you have to do first, which you can do in 2 ways:

### [async] bot.createPrivateGame
Creates a private game with a specified region, mode, and map.

```js
await bot.createPrivateGame({
    region: 'useast',
    mode: 'ffa',
    map: 'Downfall'
});
```

You can find a region list from the [matchmaker](./matchmaker) guide. Modes can be found using the [GameMode constant](../tools/constants). Maps can be found using the [Map constant](../tools/constants). It's just the map name.

### [async] bot.initMatchmaker
This manually creates of a [Matchmaker](./matchmaker) on a Bot. This is useful for finding public games.

You should, if logging in and attempting to find a publix game:
- Create a bot with `new Bot()`
- Call `bot.login()` with the proper credentials
- Call `bot.initMatchmaker()`
- Call `bot.matchmaker.findPublicGame()`
- Call `bot.join(name, code)`

There are several important things about the matchmaker that don't relate, so let's use a bullet pointed list:

- If you don't login before using initMatchmaker, it will first create an anonymous account, attach the anon account to the bot, then use that anon account until you call `login()`. This is why you should really call `login()` first.
- The matchmaker will use the proxy you used to create the bot.
- The Matchmaker will disconnect & (temporarily?) blacklist you if you spam `findPublicGame` on the same proxy ~10 times.
- This will automatically be run anytime you use `bot.join()` or `bot.createPrivateGame()`, so you don't need to call this unless you're doing something special (e.g. finding a public game and joining it).

### [async] bot.join
Join a public game with the provided game code.

```js
await bot.join('My Bot Name', 'game-code-here');
```

You can also pass a result directly from the Matchmaker:

```js
const game = await bot.matchmaker.findGame({ region: 'useast', mode: 'ffa' });
await bot.join('My Bot Name', game);
```

## bot.game
This has various information about the current game.

- `bot.game.code` - the game code of the game
- `bot.game.gameMode` - the game mode of the game (instanceof [GameMode](../tools/constants))
- `bot.game.map` - the map of the game (instanceof [Map](../tools/constants))
- `bot.game.playerLimit` - the player limit of the game
- `bot.game.isGameOwner` - if the bot is the game owner
- `bot.game.isPrivate` - if the game is private
- `bot.game.options` - the options of the game
    - `bot.game.options.gravity` - the gravity of the game
    - `bot.game.options.damage` - the damage of the game

    - `bot.game.options.locked` - if the game is locked
    - `bot.game.options.noTeamChange` - if the game has no team change
    - `bot.game.options.noTeamShuffle` - if the game has no team shuffle
    - `bot.game.options.weaponsDisabled` - the weapons disabled in the game - in the order of [GunList](../tools/constants) - 1 = disabled, 0 = enabled
    - `bot.game.options.mustUseSecondary` - if the player must use the secondary weapon due to all weapons being disabled
- `bot.game.teamScore` - the team score of the game
- `bot.game.spatula` - the spatula of the game
    - `bot.game.spatula.coords` - the coords of the spatula
    - `bot.game.spatula.controlledBy` - the player id controlling the spatula
    - `bot.game.spatula.controlledByTeam` - the team controlling the spatula
- `bot.game.stage` - the stage of the game (instanceof [CoopStates](../tools/constants))
- `bot.game.zoneNumber` - the active coop zone number
- `bot.game.activeZone` - an array of x/y/z coord objects that the current zone consists of
- `bot.game.capturing` - the users capturing the coop
- `bot.game.captureProgress` - a number 1-1000 that signifies the progress of the capture
- `bot.game.numCapturing` - the number of players capturing
- `bot.game.stageName` - the name of the game stage (as `bot.game.stage` is a number)
- `bot.game.capturePercent` - the capture percent of the game (as `bot.game.captureProgress` is a number, this is for convenience)
- `bot.game.collectables` - an array with index 0 as an ammo array and index 1 as a grenade array -- each ammo has an ID and an x/y/z coord

## Game Actions
Here are some things you can do inside of a game.

### bot.dispatch
Allows you to [dispatch](../how/dispatches) an action.

```js
import LookAtDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatch/LookAtDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new LookAtDispatch(0));
```

This is how you do most things. Read the [dispatch](../how/dispatches) guide for more information.

### bot.quit
This closes the connection to the game, the matchmaker, and runs various cleanup functions.

Cleanup includes deleting things that are heavy on memory (like `bot.account`, `bot.game`, `bot.players`, etc). That might not be something you want. If so, pass the first argument as `true` to `bot.quit` (so `bot.quit(true)`).

## Utilities
These are utilities that can be used in a game.

### bot.canSee
This allows you to check if the bot can see a player.

```js
if (bot.canSee(bot.players[0])) {
    console.log('I can see the first player that joined!');
}
```

The first argument is a `GamePlayer` from `bot.players`.

### bot.getBestTarget
Returns the closest player that is in the bot's LoS. Returns `null` if no one is in the bot's LoS.

```js
const bestTarget = bot.getBestTarget();
if (bestTarget) {
    bot.dispatch(new LookAtDispatch(bestTarget.id));
    bot.dispatch(new FireDispatch(1));
}
```

## bot.players
`bot.players` is an array of players that have information about each player.

<Note>bot.me is a reference to the `bot.players` object that represents you.</Note>

- `bot.players[i].id` - the id of the player relative to the players

## Misc Attributes
Here are some extra attributes that you might want to note:

- `bot.pathing.followingPath` - if the bot is following a path
    - setting this to false/true can pause/"play" pathfinding
    - there's a lot more on `bot.pathing`, but it's mostly for advanced users
- `bot.ping` - the websocket latency (ping)
- `bot.matchmaker` - an instance of [matchmaker](./matchmaker) that uses the bot's proxy & auth
    - this is not automatically created, you may need `bot.initMatchmaker()`
- `bot.state.weaponIdx` - you can change this before you join a game to change the weapon the bot joins with
