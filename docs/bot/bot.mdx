```js
import Bot from 'yolkbot/bot';
```

You can create one using the standard constructor format:

```js
const bot = new Bot();
```

The constructor has one parameter, which is an object with configuration. The configuration object can have the following properties:

```js
const bot = new Bot({
    intents: [], // an array of intents - see Intents section below

    proxy: 'socks4://69.69.69.69:4200', // a socks4 OR socks5 proxy url for the bot
    instance: 'eggboy.xyz', // the instance of Shell Shockers to connect to, default "shellshock.io"
    protocol: 'wss', // the protocol to use, default "wss" (for secure websockets)
})
```

From there, you can use the various methods and attributes of the bot.

All of these have a default value. If you're not sure what to do, you can just create a bot with `new Bot()` and it will work fine:

```js
const bot = new Bot();
```

The entire bot file got too large, so it's been split up into a ton of smaller files.

You should read the following file in full:

- [Intents](./intents) - an explanation of how to enable various features

You should read the following files based on what you plan to use yolkbot for:

- [Account Management](./account)
- [Game Management](./game)

If you become confused with dispatches, refer to the [dispatches](../how/dispatches) guide.

## Hooks
Hooks allow you to listen for various events and then (theoretically) do something with them. Note that some hooks aren't specific to the game, like the `banned` hook. 

### bot.on
This is how you listen to a [hook](../how/hooks) on the bot.

```js
bot.on('playerJoin', (player) => {
    console.log('a player joined! say hi to ' + player.name);
    // some custom logic might go here
});
```

You can get a list of hooks in the [hook guide](../how/hooks).

### bot.onAny
This is how you add a listener to ALL hooks. Since this includes things like packets, ticks, and pings (which occur very frequently), this probably isn't good unless you're debugging issues.

```js
bot.onAny((eventName, data) => {
    console.log('event ' + eventName + ' was called with data: ' + data);
});
```

`data` is what would be passed to the specified event name. So, for a `playerJoin`, eventName = `playerJoin` and data = `playerThatJoined`.
