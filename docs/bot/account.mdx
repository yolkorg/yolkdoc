None of these methods require you to join a game.

## Login Methods
There are 4 ways to become authorized. These are all asynchronous and should be `await`ed. They also all return the same thing, which is either an error string or `bot.account`.

### [async] bot.createAccount
Creates an account with an email and password.

```js
await bot.createAccount('email@example.com', 'MyEpicPassword123!!');
```

### [async] bot.login
Logs you into an account using an email and password. If you do not call this, joining a game will create and use an anonymous account.

```js
await bot.login('email@example.com', 'MyEpicPassword123!!');
```

### [async] bot.loginWithRefreshToken
Logs you into an account using a Firebase refresh token.

This is currently a method that does not violate Google's ToS (automation). It also works with Facebook, although no one uses Facebook. It could also be used for email/password, although it is technically less stable.

To obtain a refresh token from Shell, run the following console script while logged into your account:

```js
const notLoggedIn = () => console.error('You do not appear to be logged in.');

const request = indexedDB.open('firebaseLocalStorageDb');

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
    const db = event.target.result;
    const transaction = db.transaction(['firebaseLocalStorage'], 'readonly');
    const store = transaction.objectStore('firebaseLocalStorage');

    const getAllKeysRequest = store.getAllKeys();

    getAllKeysRequest.onsuccess = function() {
        const getRequest = store.get(getAllKeysRequest.result[0]);

        getRequest.onsuccess = function() {
            window.copy = () => {
                document.querySelector('#cp').remove();
                navigator.clipboard.writeText(getRequest.result.value.stsTokenManager.refreshToken)
            };
            document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', `<div style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width: 100%;height:100%;background:black;cursor:pointer;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;z-index:999999;" onclick="copy()" id="cp"><h1 style="color:white;font-family:'Nunito';font-weight:bold;">click me to copy token!</h1></div>`);
        };

        getRequest.onerror = () => notLoggedIn();
    };

    getAllKeysRequest.onerror = () => notLoggedIn();
};

request.onerror = () => notLoggedIn();
```

This will create a black screen with a white text that says "click me to copy token!". Clicking it will copy the refresh token to your clipboard. Then, put it into `loginWithRefreshToken`:

```js
await bot.loginWithRefreshToken('some-VeRy-L0ng-rAndomTexT-heRe');
```

### [async] bot.loginAnonymously
Logs you into a guest/anonymous account. This is the default behavior if you do not call either of the above authorization functions and attempt to do something like joining a game.

```js
await bot.loginAnonymously();
```

## bot.account
This is an object that stores account information.

- `bot.account.id` - the id of the account
- `bot.account.firebaseId` - the firebase id (for auth)
- `bot.account.sessionId` - the session id (for auth)
- `bot.account.session` - the session (for auth)
- `bot.account.email` - the raw email of the account
- `bot.account.password` - the raw password (plaintext, be careful) of the account
- `bot.account.ownedItemIds` - the owned items' IDs
- `bot.account.vip` - if the account is vip status
- `bot.account.accountAge` - the age of the account in milliseconds
- `bot.account.emailVerified` - if the account's email is verified
- `bot.account.eggBalance` - the egg balance
- `bot.account.cw` - cw status
    - `bot.account.cw.atLimit` - if the account is at the limit for the day
    - `bot.account.cw.limit` - the number of times the account has played cw that day
    - `bot.account.cw.secondsUntilPlay` - the number of seconds until the account can play again
    - `bot.account.cw.canPlayAgain` - the timestamp the account can play again
- `bot.account.stats` - user stats
    - `bot.account.stats.montly` - monthly stats
    - `bot.account.stats.lifetime` - lifetime stats
    - structure for both: [click](https://github.com/enbyte/yolkbot/blob/cebc489c180240773905a1159024b1a0907e4b7b/src/types/bot.d.ts#L26C1-L62C2)
    - requires `STATS` [intent](./intents)

## Chikn Winner
These methods allow you to play Chikn Winner.

### [async] bot.checkChiknWinner
Allows you to check the status of the Chikn Winner minigame for the account. It returns something like this:

```js
await bot.checkChiknWinner() /* -> {
    atLimit: false,
    limit: 1,
    secondsUntilPlay: 240,
    canPlayAgain: 1742002470386
} */
```

More information is in the explanation for `bot.account.cw` below.

### [async] bot.playChiknWinner
Allows you to play the Chikn Winner minigame. It will either return what you pulled, which either is eggs:

```js
await bot.playChiknWinner() /* -> {
    eggsGiven: 100,
    itemIds: [],
    rewardTier: 2
} */
```

or an item:

```js
await bot.playChiknWinner() /* -> {
    eggsGiven: 0,
    itemIds: [3066],
    rewardTier: 1
} */
```

It may also return a string, which is one of these errors:

- `hit_daily_limit` - the bot has hit the daily limit, run `bot.resetChiknWinner()` to reset the limit for 200 eggs
- `on_cooldown` - chikn winner is on cooldown, see `bot.account.cw.secondsUntilPlay` for the seconds until you can play again
- `session_expired` - the bot's session expired, usually because the bot's account was deleted due to bot detection
- `unknown_error` - an unknown error returned by shell - create an issue on github with the content in the console

### [async] bot.resetChiknWinner
Allows you to reset Chikn Winner for 200 eggs if you have hit the daily limit.

If it successfully resets, it will return the Chikn Winner status (from `bot.checkChiknWinner()`).

It may also fail, returning one of these errors:
- `not_at_limit` - the bot is not at the limit for the day, and you should play normally
- `not_enough_eggs` - the bot does not have enough eggs to reset
- `unknown_error` - an unknown error returned by shell - create an issue on github with the content in the console
