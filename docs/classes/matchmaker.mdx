The Matchmaker is how you can connect to the game server to find things like public games.

<Warning>Usually, a Matchmaker will be connected to a Bot. You really shouldn't ever need to create one yourself. To use a Matchmaker with a bot, see [`bot.initMatchmaker()`](./bot)</Warning>

The Matchmaker initially has two parameters: a custom session ID and a proxy.

```js
import Matchmaker from 'yolkbot/matchmaker';

const mm = new Matchmaker('customSessionId', 'socks5://proxy.com:6969');
```

If a custom sesssion ID is omitted, the matchmaker will create an anonymous account and use that session ID. If a proxy is omitted, no proxy will be used.

<Note>Upon constructing a Matchmaker, it will connect to and then infinitely reconnect to the matchmaker WebSocket. Using `<Matchmaker>.ws.close()` will **instantly reopen the connection**. If you need to close the Matchmaker, use `<Matchmaker>.close()`</Note>

## Methods
These are all the things you can run on a `Matchmaker`.

<Note>A Matchmaker has an EventEmitter system, meaning the matchmaker allows you to use `on`/`off`/`once`. This is assumed that you understand this. For an idea on how to use these functions, see the Node [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/the-nodejs-event-emitter) documentation. Note that you cannot call `emit`.</Note>

### [async] waitForConnect
An easy async function that lets you wait for the Matchmaker to connect.

```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();

console.log(matchmaker.connected); // ==> false
await matchmaker.waitForConnect();
console.log(matchmaker.connected) // ==> true
```

### [async] getRegions
This fetches the region list from the game and then returns it, as well as stores it in `<Matchmaker>.regionList`.

Example usage:
```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();
const regionList = await matchmaker.getRegions();

console.log(regionList); // ==> [{ id: 'sydney', sub: 'egs...' }, { id: 'useast', 'sub': 'egs...' }]
console.log(matchmaker.regionList); // ==> [{ id: 'sydney', sub: 'egs...' }, { id: 'useast', sub: 'egs...' }]
console.log(regionList == matchmaker.regionList) // ==> true
```

This will be required for `getRandomRegion()`, as well as region validation in `findGame()`.

<Note>If you use the Matchmaker as part of a `Bot`, this is automatically called.</Note>

### [async] findGame
This finds a game with the specified parameters, `region` and `mode`.

A region list can be found using `getRegions()`, and will a specified region **will only be validated if `getRegions()` has previously been called**.

The `mode` can be any of the following: `ffa`, `team`, `spatula`, & `kotc`.

It will return a standardized game object similar to the following:

```js
{
  command: 'gameFound',
  region: 'santiago', // the game region
  subdomain: 'egs-static-live-santiago-1s5w3cdc',
  id: 'just-mode-hawk', // the game code
  uuid: '...',
  private: false,
  noobLobby: false
}
```

The game code is `<response>.id`. You can connect to this using `<Player>.join(code)`.

Example usage:

```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();

let regions = await matchmaker.getRegions()

const game = await matchmaker.findGame({
    region: regions[0].id, // --> 'sydney', 'useast', 'germany', etc
    mode: 'ffa'
}); // ==> a game object
```

### getRandomRegion
Get a random region ID that can be directly passed to findGame().

You MUST have previously called `getRegions()`.

```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();

await matchmaker.getRegions()

const game = await matchmaker.findGame({
    region: matchmaker.getRandomRegion()
    mode: 'ffa'
}); // ==> a game object
```

### getRandomGameMode
Get a random game mode ID that can be directly passed to findGame.

```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();

const game = await matchmaker.findGame({
    region: 'useast'
    mode: matchmaker.getRandomGameMode()
}); // ==> a game object
```

### send
Sends a custom WebSocket message through the Matchmaker. This is automatically stringified, so all you need to pass is a JSON.

```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();

matchmaker.send({
    command: 'joinGame',
    id: 'game-code-here',
    observe: false,
    sessionId: '...'
});
```

<Warning>You should NEVER call `joinGame` directly! It is something a `Bot` does for you. Use a `Bot` if you need to join a game. This event is here as an EXAMPLE USE, **NOT** a recommended one.</Warning>

### close
As mentioned above in the constructor, directly closing the matchmaker WebSocket (`<Matchmaker>.ws.close()`) will cause it to instantly reopen, doing effectively nothing. In order to prevent it from reopening, call `close()`.

```js
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker();

// do NOT do this!
matchmaker.ws.close();
console.log(matchmaker.connected) // ==> true

// do THIS instead!
matchmaker.close();
console.log(matchmaker.connected) // ==> false
```
