description: "The methods & attributes of a Bot."

This is a generic Bot.

```js
import Bot from 'yolkbot/bot';
```

You can create one using the standard constructor format:

```js
const bot = new Bot();
```

The constructor has one parameter, which is an object with configuration. The configuration object can have the following properties:

```js
const bot = new Bot({
    name: 'My Bot', // the name of the bot
    proxy: 'socks4://69.69.69.69:4200', // a socks4 OR socks5 proxy url for the bot

    doPing: true, // should the bot automatically ping the server for latency?
    pingInterval: 1000, // how often should the bot ping the server for latency? 1000 is shell's default

    doUpdate: true, // should the bot automatically update? (see how/updates)
    updateInterval: 5, // how often should the bot update? (see how/updates)

    doPathing: true, // should the bot run map node finding / pathfinding logic?

    instance: 'eggboy.xyz', // the instance of Shell Shockers to connect to, default "shellshock.io"
})
```

From there, you can use the various methods and attributes of the bot.

All of these have a default value. The only one to do if you're not sure about this is the `name` value:

```js
const bot = new Bot({
    name: 'My Bot'
});
```

## Methods
Methods are things that allow you to run actions on a `Bot` instance.

A method tagged with the `[async]` tag means that it is an asynchronous function, and you should use `await` when calling it.

For example, here is a normal method:

```js
bot.method();
```

Here is an `[async]` method:

```js
await bot.asyncMethod();
```

If you have errors relating to "await being called in a non-async function", you should read [this article](https://javascript.info/async-await), which helps explain how async/await work as well as how to properly use them.

### [async] bot.login
Logs you into an account using an email and password. If you do not call this, joining a game will create and use an anonymous account.

```js
await bot.login('email@example.com', 'MyEpicPassword123!!');
```

### bot.dispatch
Allows you to [dispatch](../how/dispatches) an action to the game server.

```js
import LookAtDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatch/LookAtDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new LookAtDispatch(0));
```

If you become confused with dispatches, refer to the [dispatches](../how/dispatches) guide.

### [async] bot.createPrivateGame
Creates a private game with a specified region, mode, and map.

```js
await bot.createPrivateGame({
    region: 'useast',
    mode: 'ffa',
    map: 0 // aqueduct
});
```

You can find a region list from the [matchmaker](./matchmaker) guide.

Modes can be found using the [GameMode constant](../util/constants).

Maps can be found using the [Map constant](../util/constants). Use the ID of the map, or the index of where it is in the array. For example, to find the ID of the Castle map, you'd do this:

```js
import { Maps } from 'yolkbot/constants';

let castleInfo = Maps.find((map) => map.name === 'Castle');
let castleId = Maps.indexOf(castleInfo);
```

You'd then pass that `castleId` to the `Map` parameter.

### [async] bot.join
Join a public game with the provided game code.

```js
await bot.join('game-code-here');
```

You can also pass a result directly from the Matchmaker:

```js
const game = await bot.matchmaker.findGame({ region: 'useast', mode: 'ffa' });
await bot.join(game);
```

### bot.update
This runs a manual update for the bot. Do not call this unless you have a *clear understanding* how [updates](../how/updates) work.

```js
bot.update();
```

### bot.on
This is how you listen to a [hook](../how/hooks) on the bot. You can listen to any hook that is available.

```js
bot.on('playerJoin', (player) => {
    console.log('a player joined! say hi to ' + player.name);
});
```

You can get a list of hooks in the [hook guide](../how/hooks).

### bot.onAny
This is how you listen for ALL events in the bot. Since this includes things like packets, ticks, and pings, this probably isn't good unless you're debugging issues.

```js
bot.onAny((eventName, data) => {
    console.log('event ' + eventName + ' was called with data: ' + data);
});
```

`data` is what would be passed to the specified event name. So, for a `playerJoin`, eventName = `playerJoin and data = `playerThatJoined`.

### [async] bot.initMatchmaker
This manually creates of a [Matchmaker](./matchmaker) on a Bot. This is why you really should never create a Matchmaker unless you don't plan to join a game at any point.

You should, if logging in and attempting to find regions:
- Create a bot with `new Bot()`
- Call `bot.login()` with the proper credentials
- Call `bot.initMatchmaker()`
- Call the various matchmaker calls you need to
- Call `bot.join(code)`

There are several important things about the matchmaker that don't relate, so let's use a bullet pointed list:

- If you don't login before using initMatchmaker, it will first create an anonymous account, attach the anon account to the bot, then use that anon account until you call `login()`. This is why you should really call `login()` first.
- The matchmaker will use the proxy you used to create the bot. Note that the Matchmaker will disconnect if you spam `findPublicGame` on the same proxy ~10 times.
- The matchmaker will use the same proxy as the bot.
- This will automatically be run anytime you use `bot.join()` or `bot.createPrivateGame()`, so you don't need to call this unless you're doing something special (e.g. finding a public game and joining it).

## Attributes
These are variables on `bot.*` that let you get information about the Bot.
