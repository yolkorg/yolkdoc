yolkbot can be used in the browser, which allows you to use the biggest parts of yolkbot!

The only thing that changes between Node.JS and the browser is how modules are imported. Since you can't directly just import a pacakge name, you have to use a CDN to access it. Our recommended one is `esm.sh`. For example:

```js
import Bot from 'yolkbot/bot'; // ❌ this won't work in the browser
let { Bot } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/browser'); // ✅ this is the proper method of browser importing
```

<Note>You may notice the brackets around the Bot in the correct example. **This is how you import things in the browser**. For anything, put brackets around it. Instead of `import Matchmaker from ...`, use `let { Matchmaker } = await ...`. This avoids some ugly bugs.</Note>

Imports in the browser all come from one file, `https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/browser`, which is the browser bundle of yolkbot.

```js
let { Bot, Matchmaker } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/browser');
```

To import Dispatches, either destructure the dispatches object:

```js
// this will give you access to Bot, ChatDispatch, and SpawnDispatch
let { Bot, Dispatches: { ChatDispatch, SpawnDispatch } } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/browser');

bot.dispatch(new ChatDispatch());
```

Or import the dispatches object directly and refer to it:

```js
let { Bot, Dispatches } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/browser');

bot.dispatch(new Dispatches.ChatDispatch());
```

## Import List
These are all the things that can be imported.

```js
let {
    Bot, // the Bot class
    GamePlayer, // represents an empty bot.player object, only useful for typing

    Matchmaker, // the Matchmaker class

    Dispatches, // the Dispatches object with each dispatch, use Dispatches.ChatDispatch

    // or destructure dispatches!
    Dispatches: {
        ChatDispatch, // this would let you refer to ChatDispatch without the "Dispatches." prefix
        SpawnDispatch // this would let you refer to SpawnDispatch without the "Dispatches." prefix
    },

    // you can do the same destructuring thing with all of the things like API, Comm, etc that are objects

    API, // the API object with each API function, use API.loginAnonymously, API.loginWithCredentials, etc
    Comm, // the Comm object with each comm class, use Comm.CommIn, Comm.CommOut, Comm.Code, etc
    Packet, // the Packet object with each packet class, use Packet.BootPacket, Packet.ChatPacket, etc

    Constants, // all of the constants, use Constants.IsBrowser, Constants.GunList, etc
    Guns, // all of the guns: Eggk-47, Scrambler, etc
    Items, // the item array
    Maps // the map array
} = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/browser');
```

Somewhat simple.

## Patching out items
Items take up a TON of space in a bundle, and if you don't use the `COSMETIC_DATA` intent, there's no reasomn to bundle them. We recommend you use a tool like [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to patch out the items from the bundle. This will make your bundle size much smaller, and make it easier to load in the browser.

Here's an example patch file:

```patch
diff --git a/dist/constants/findItemById.js b/dist/constants/findItemById.js
index c9f05c9487ae21ea4fc1ee17b387e14395daa639..e7eac0dcad66d8884655c43103b19d1e113f5470 100644
--- a/dist/constants/findItemById.js
+++ b/dist/constants/findItemById.js
@@ -1,3 +1 @@
-import { Items } from './items.js';
-
-export const findItemById = (id) => Items.find(item => item.id === id);
\ No newline at end of file
+export const findItemById = (id) => null;
\ No newline at end of file
```

With Bun, you can run `bun patch yolkbot` and edit `dist/constants/findItemById.js` to simply have the content:

```js
export const findItemById = (id) => null;
```

This will remove the items from the bundle, and make it 90% smaller (literally).

## Removed in the Browser
In the browser edition, the big thing removed is **proxy support**. The browser can't use proxies for requests or WebSockets, which removes a (kind of big) feature in yolkbot. If you don't plan to need proxies, the browser is likely still a good choice.

Happy botting!
