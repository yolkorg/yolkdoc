yolkbot can be used in the browser with 100% library support!

The only thing that changes between Node.JS and the browser is how modules are imported. Since you can't directly just import a pacakge name, you have to use a CDN to access it. Our recommended one is `esm.sh`. For example:

```js
import Bot from 'yolkbot/bot'; // ❌ this won't work in the browser
let { Bot } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/bot'); // ✅ this is the proper method of browser importing
```

<Note>You may notice the brackets around the Bot in the correct example. **This is how you import things in the browser**. For anything, put brackets around it. Instead of `import Matchmaker from ...`, use `let { Matchmaker } = await ...`. This avoids some ugly bugs.</Note>

Here are some more example imports in the browser:

```js
let { Bot } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/bot');
let { Matchmaker } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/matchmaker');

// you can use just '/dispatch' to bulk import dispatches
let { ChatDispatch, SpawnDispatch } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/dispatch');

// if you want cleaner code, you can import them individually
let { ChatDispatch } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/dispatch/ChatDispatch');
let { SpawnDispatch } = await import('https://esm.sh/yolkbot@latest/dispatch/SpawnDispatch');
```

Although yolkbot supports the browser, we recommend using Node for several reasons:

1. The browser is slow. Anything you do will take a long time. This isn't anything we can control, it's just how browsers work.
    - For example, loading the library takes around 5 seconds before the first code is executed.
    - In another example, authorization is around 2x slower.
2. The browser is limited.
    - For example, you're unable to use proxies. Browsers just don't support proxied WebSockets.
    - Additionally, whatever scope you run the bots in is ultimately limited in terms of resources. A tab can only use up so much CPU or RAM before most browsers shut it down.
3. The browser is insecure.
    - If you run the bots on, say, Shell Shockers, you're allowing Shell Shockers to potentially tamper with the bots or detect your IP botting. (If we ever find the game tampering with bot behavior, we'll obviously fix it. It's ultimately just a risk you need to take when running any code on a website.)

That being said, the browser still works pretty well. If you're just testing things out or want to run a bot on a website, the browser is a great way to do it. Just be aware of the limitations and risks.

Happy botting!
