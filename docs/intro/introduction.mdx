yolkbot is a highly efficient, easy-to-use bot system for Shell Shockers. It's designed to be as simple as possible, while still being powerful enough to have 100% coverage (meaning it does literally everything in the game).

yolkbot was created by 1ust (hi, that's me) to solve 3 problems:

1. Shell Shockers is a game that is constantly changing, and the bots need to be able to adapt to those changes.
  - In the past, bots have been created that are too slow to adapt to the changes in the game, or are too complex to be able to adapt at all.
  - yolkbot fixes this issue by simply making everything flexible internally while automatically updating crucial data (like maps, items, etc.) when the game changes.
2. Shell Shockers bots require hundreds of lines of code to do simple things, like joining a game.
  - yolkbot fixes this issue by creating a unified way to create bots that can do anything in the game with just a few lines of code.
  - Furthermore, yolkbot covers **100%** of the game, meaning you can do anything from creating a bot that farms eggs, to a bot that plays chikn winner, to a bot that redeems codes from Twitch chat - all under 50 lines of code.
3. Shell Shockers needs a global botting library.
  - yolkbot fixes this issue by creating a global botting library that can be used for any purpose.
  - yolkbot is public! This means that anyone can use it, and anyone can contribute to it. This is a huge step forward for the Shell Shockers community, and I hope that you will join us in making yolkbot the best (and only) botting library for Shell Shockers.

<Note>I know that no one wants to read 100 pages of documentation. There *are* a lot of pages, but most of them are short, and I try to make them somewhat entertaining with bad humor while throwing the information at your face.</Note>
