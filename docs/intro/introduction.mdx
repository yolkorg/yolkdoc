In the past, attempts at bots have either been automating tabs of Shell Shockers, or abusing [essentially fake] Node.JS workers to run a bot. To put it simply, this doesn't work very well.

The point of yolkbot is to create a simple, easy-to-use, and efficient bot system that covers all of Shell's game. These bots can be automated to do anything - train aim with, farm eggs, fight against, or even track stats (i'm looking at you, leagues)!

The ending idea is that you will be able to create a bot that automates the 300+ line join process in just a few line of code. As we've expanded this codebase from a few events to nearly covering the entire game, that same principle has been applied. The codebase is consistent, easy to use, and easy to expand upon.

<Note>We know that no one wants to read, like, 100 pages of documentation. There *are* a lot of pages, but most of them are short, and I try to make them somewhat entertaining while throwing the information at your face.</Note>
