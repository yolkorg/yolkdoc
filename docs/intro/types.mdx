yolkbot has (almost) full Typescript support! This means that you can use yolkbot in a Typescript project and get full type checking and intellisense. IDEs like VSCode will supprot yolkbot's types and autocomplete things, making it easier to write code.

### Supported Types
All of these modules 
- `yolkbot/api`
- `yolkbot/bot`
- `yolkbot/constants/*`
- `yolkbot/dispatch/*`
- `yolkbot/matchmaker`
- `yolkbot/socket`

### Unsupported Types
These are not supposed due to the high complexity. Users using these modules should really know the code or how they work.

- `yolkbot/comm`
- `yolkbot/packet`

<Note>The browser edition of yolkbot does not have types. This is because the browser edition is a single file that is not compiled with Typescript. If you want to use types, you must use the Node edition.</Note>
