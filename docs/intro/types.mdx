yolkbot has (almost) full Typescript support! This means that you can use yolkbot in a Typescript project and get full type checking and intellisense. IDEs like VSCode will support yolkbot's types and autocomplete things even if you use Javascript, making it easier to write code.

### Supported Types
All of these modules are fully typed!

- `yolkbot/api`
- `yolkbot/bot`
- `yolkbot/comm/*`
- `yolkbot/constants/*`
- `yolkbot/dispatch/*`
- `yolkbot/matchmaker`
- `yolkbot/socket`
- `yolkbot/util`

Types are bundled in the package; there is no need to install them separately. `@types/yolkbot` doesn't exist for this reason.

We've slowly typed everything and then checked everything throughout various projects. Types are 99% accurate, and we're always testing and finding any issues.

<Note>The browser edition of yolkbot does not contain types. This is because the browser edition is a single file that is not compiled with Typescript. If you want to use types, you must use the Node edition.</Note>

<Note>Pathfinding is not typed. It's too much of a headache, and I've never needed it in a Typescript project, so I've neber added types.</Note>
