You can install yolkbot using whatever package manager supports your needs. We heavily recommend using **yarn** or **bun**.

<Note>We also support the browser! This guide doesn't help you much in terms of browser usage, so we recommend you read [the browser guide](../how/browser) if you want to use yolkbot in the browser.</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install yolkbot@latest
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm install yolkbot@latest
```

```sh yarn
yarn add yolkbot@latest
```

```sh bun
bun add yolkbot@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also choose to use the alpha version, where we test features still in development. This is not recommended for production use, and should be used if you have a specific feature you want to use. Install `yolkbot@alpha` to help us out with testing!

<Note>We only use one package, `yolkbot` -- do not install any others, as they are not supported and may lead to you being hacked. The legacy `yolkbot-alpha` package is no longer supported.</Note>

Once you have yolkbot installed, you can create a new bot in just a few lines of code. Here's an example of a simple bot that joins a game an logs when players join:

```js
import Bot from 'yolkbot/bot';

const bot = new Bot();

bot.on('playerJoin', (player) => {
    console.log(`${player.name} joined the game!`);
});

await bot.join('my bot name', 'game-code-here');
```

It's that easy! From here, you can learn how the bot works by reading the following key pages:

- [Dispatches](../how/dispatches)
- [Hooks](../how/hooks)
- [Updates](../how/updates)

These are the three main things you need to know about yolkbot, and will help you understand how to create a bot that does exactly what you want it to do. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gYugVUCaMr)!
