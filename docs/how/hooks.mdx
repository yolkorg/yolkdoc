Hooks are how you find out what's going on in game. They are called when certain events happen, and you can use them to do things like log information, send messages, or even dispatch other actions.

If you've ever used Discord.JS or some other library with a `.on` system, that's what a hook is, we just needed a creative name for it.

```js
bot.on('playerJoin', (player) => {
    console.log(`${player.name} has joined the game!`);
});
```

## Hook List
Each hook has a basic example and description of usage.

- [authFail](#authfail)
- [balanceUpdate](#balanceupdate)
- [banned](#banned)
- [chat](#chat)
- [close](#close)

- [collectGrenade](#collectgrenade)
- [gameForcePause](#gameforcepause)
- [gameOptionsChange](#gameoptionschange)

- [pingUpdate](#pingupdate)
- [playerBeginStreak](#playerbeginstreak)
- [playerChangeCharacter](#playerchangecharacter)

They are not individual files. I'm too lazy to create all of them!

## Hooks
This is the entire list. My fingers will probably hurt.

### authFail
This is called when Firebase authentication fails. Usually, it is accompanied by several console errors.

```js
bot.on('authFail', () => {
    console.log('ah, shoot. auth failed. above me is probably why.');
});
```

### balanceUpdate
This is called when the bot's egg balance updates, likely due to the bot killing someone.

- `oldBalance` is a number
- `newBalance` is a number

```js
bot.on('balanceUpdate', (oldBalance, newBalance) => {
    console.log(`bot's balance was ${oldBalance}, now it's ${newBalance}`);
    console.log(`the bot gained ${newBalance - oldBalance} eggs!`);
});
```

### banned
This is called when the bot is banned and cannot complete authentication. If you get this event, the Bot can't be further used.

- `banRemaining` is a string in the format `HH:MM:SS`

```js
bot.on('banned', (banRemaining) => {
    console.log(`bot is banned for ${banRemaining}, and cannot authenticate. RIP`);
});
```

### chat
This is called when a chat message is sent in the game.

- `player` is a Player object
- `message` is a string
- `flags` is a number

```js
bot.on('chat', (player, message, flags) => {
    if (player) console.log(`${player.name} said: ${message}`);
    else if (flags === 255) console.log(`<SERVER (probably Harrison)> ${message}`);
    else if (flags === 254) console.log(`<Mod> ${message}`);
    else console.log(`Unknown sourced chat message: ${message}`);
});
```

### close
This is called when the bot's connection to the game is closed.

- `code` is a number

```js
bot.on('close', (code) => {
    console.log('bot has disconnected from the game with code', code);
});
```

You can compare this to the `CloseCode` [constant](../util/constants).

### collectAmmo
This is called when a player collects an ammo pack.

- `player` is a Player object
- `weapon` is a Gun class (see [Gun](../util/constants))

```js
bot.on('collectAmmo', (player, weapon) => {
    console.log(`${player.name} collected ${weapon.ammo.pickup} ammo for their ${weapon.weaponName}!`);
});
```

### collectGrenade
This is called when a player collects a grenade.

- `player` is a Player object

```js
bot.on('collectGrenade', (player) => {
    console.log(`${player.name} collected a grenade, and now has ${player.grenades} greades!`);
});
```

### gameForcePause
This is called when the game is forcibly paused. It's not horribly clear WHEN this is called.

```js
bot.on('gameForcePause', () => {
    console.log('game has been forcibly paused, who knows why');
});
```

### gameOptionsChange
This is called when the game options change by a host in a private room.

- `oldOptions` is an object (specifically [Bot](../classes/bot).game.options)
- `newOptions` is an object (specifically [Bot](../classes/bot).game.options)

```js
bot.on('gameOptionsChange', (oldOptions, newOptions) => {
    console.log('game options have changed!');
    console.log('old options:', oldOptions);
    console.log('new options:', newOptions);
});
```

### gameReset
This is called when the game is reset by the host. This is probably when `gameForcePause` is called.

```js
bot.on('gameReset', () => {
    console.log('game has been reset!');
});
```

### gameStateChange
This is called when the game state changes. This is MAINLY used in the spatula & KOTC gamemodes, wich signify whe things like the spatula is dropped or someone starts/stops capturing a coop, among many other things.

- `oldState` is an object (specifically [Bot](../classes/bot).game.state)
- `newState` is an object (specifically [Bot](../classes/bot).game.state)

```js
import { GameModes } from 'yolkbot/constants';

bot.on('gameStateChange', (oldState, newState) => {
    console.log(`game state has changed`);
    console.log(`old state:`, oldState);
    console.log(`new state:`, newState);
});
```

The current game state can be accessed at any time with `bot.game.state`. The object is so large, documenting it here would be a headache. See the [Bot](../classes/bot) class for more information.

    console.log(`old skins:`, oldCharacter);
    console.log(`new skins:`, newCharacter);

    console.log(`new gun:`, newGun);
