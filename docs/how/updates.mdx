The update loop is how the bot processes the game. It's a loop that runs every ~33ms (100/3ms) and updates the game state. This is how we make sure that things actually work. If you want to look at a player, fire your gun, and reload, you'd have to call three dispatches:

```js
bot.dispatch(new LookAtDispatch(0));
bot.dispatch(new FireDispatch());
bot.dispatch(new ReloadDispatch());
```

Dispatches all run at the same time. If a dispatch can be run, it is instantly run. This is why we recommend binding changes to something like the `tick` event.

Every 3 updates, the bot will send a `syncMe` packet to the server that updates the bot's position, yaw, pitch, fires the gun, etc. Hence, the bot syncs things every 100 milliseconds, or 10 times a second.

Updates run automatically, and are considered so critical that they *cannot be turned off*.
