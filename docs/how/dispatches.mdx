Dispatches are how you tell the bot to do something.

```js
import SpawnDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatch/SpawnDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new SpawnDispatch());
```

## Dispatch Checks
Dispatches will always run a check to see if they can occur. This check just returns `true` or `false`.

```js
import SpawnDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatch/SpawnDispatch';

const spawnDispatch = new SpawnDispatch();

if (spawnDispatch.check(bot)) {
    bot.dispatch(spawnDispatch);
}
```

If the check returns `true`, the dispatch will be instantly executed. If the check returns `false`, the dispatch will be saved and the bot will check every ~33ms for the Dispatch to return `true`. Once it returns `true`, the dispatch will be removed from the queue and executed.

## Dispatch List
The good part! Here are all of the dispatches:

- [BootPlayerDispatch](../dispatches/bootPlayer) - boot a player from a private room
- [ChatDispatch](../dispatches/chat) - send a chat message
- [FireDispatch](../dispatches/fire) - fire the gun
- [GameOptionsDispatch](../dispatches/gameOptions) - change game settings in private rooms
- [GoToAmmoDispatch](../dispatches/goToAmmo) - go to the nearest ammo pickup
- [GoToCoopDispatch](../dispatches/goToCoop) - go to the coop
- [GoToGrenadeDispatch](../dispatches/goToGrenade) - go to the nearest grenade pickup
- [GoToPlayerDispatch](../dispatches/goToPlayer) - go to a specified player
- [GoToSpatulaDispatch](../dispatches/goToSpatula) - go to the spatula
- [LookAtDispatch](../dispatches/lookAt) - look at a player
- [LookAtPosDispatch](../dispatches/lookAtPos) - look at a position
- [MeleeDispatch](../dispatches/melee) - use the melee
- [MovementDispatch](../dispatches/movement) - move!!
- [PauseDispatch](../dispatches/pause) - pause the game (clicking esc)
- [ReloadDispatch](../dispatches/reload) - reload the gun
- [ReportPlayerDispatch](../dispatches/reportPlayer) - report someone
- [SaveLoadoutDispatch](../dispatches/saveLoadout) - change your gun & skins
- [SwapWeaponDispatch](../dispatches/swapWeapon) - swap between primary & secondary
- [SwitchTeamDispatch](../dispatches/switchTeam) - switch your team
- [ThrowGrenadeDispatch](../dispatches/throwGrenade) - throw a grenade

Each of these has their own file to explain what checks are ran and the function in a deeper form.

In the end, dispatches are fairly simple - check they can run and run them!

> [!NOTE]
> If there are 50 pending dispatches that are all returning `false` for their checks, the bot will start logging a warning to the console. This is to prevent the bot from getting stuck in a loop of checking dispatches that will never run. If you see this warning, it means that you really need to check your code and see why the dispatches are not running. It cannot be turned off, since you're likely to run out of memory if you are checking for 50+ dispatches 30 times a second (1500 dispatch checks/second).
