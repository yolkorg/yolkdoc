Dispatches are how you tell the bot to do something.

```js
import SpawnDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatch/SpawnDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new SpawnDispatch());
```

## Dispatch Checks
Dispatches will always run a check to see if they can occur. This check just returns `true` or `false`.

```js
import SpawnDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatch/SpawnDispatch';

const spawnDispatch = new SpawnDispatch();

if (spawnDispatch.check(bot)) {
    bot.dispatch(spawnDispatch);
}
```

If the check is false, the Dispatch will be saved, and the bot will check every `tick` for the Dispatch to return `true`. Once it does, the Dispatch will be executed.

## Dispatch List
The good part! Here are all of the dispatches:

- [BootPlayerDispatch](../dispatches/bootPlayer) - boot a player from a private room
- [ChatDispatch](../dispatches/chat) - send a chat message
- [FireDispatch](../dispatches/fire) - fire the gun
- [GameOptionsDispatch](../dispatches/gameOptions) - change game settings in private rooms
- [LookAtDispatch](../dispatches/lookAt) - look at a player
- [LookAtPosDispatch](../dispatches/lookAtPos) - look at a position
- [LookToDispatch](../dispatches/lookTo) - look in a specified direction
- [MeleeDispatch](../dispatches/melee) - use the melee
- [MovementDispatch](../dispatches/movement) - move!!
- [PathfindDispatch](../dispatches/pathfind) - pathfind to a player
- [PauseDispatch](../dispatches/pause) - pause the game (basically clicking esc)
- [ReloadDispatch](../dispatches/reload) - reload the gun
- [ReportPlayerDispatch](../dispatches/reportPlayer) - report someone
- [SaveLoadoutDispatch](../dispatches/saveLoadout) - change your gun & skins
- [SwapWeaponDispatch](../dispatches/swapWeapon) - swap between primary & secondary
- [SwitchTeamDispatch](../dispatches/switchTeam) - switch your team

Each of these has their own file to explain what checks are ran and the function in a deeper form.

In the end, dispatches are fairly simple - check they can run and run them!
