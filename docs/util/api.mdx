<Note>You probably shouldn't directly use any of these. Most of them are used internally and exposed for *advanced users*.</Note>

### [async] loginAnonymously
This lets you login anonymously. It returns a response from the `auth` services command.

```js
import { loginAnonymously } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await loginAnonymously();
console.log(response);
```

This gives you a lot of information about the anonymous account.

You can also pass a proxy (socks4 or socks5) to use on the servies query as the first argument.

### [async] loginWithCredentials
This lets you login with a specified email and password.

```js
import { loginWithCredentials } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await loginWithCredentials('email@example.com', 'ThisIsAPassword123!');
console.log(response);
```

You can also pass a proxy (socks4 or socks5) to use on the servies query as the third argument.

### [async] queryServices
This lets you directly query the `services` socket.

```js
import { queryServices } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await queryServices({ cmd: 'auth', firebaseToken: '...' });
console.log(response);
```

You can also pass a proxy (socks4 or socks5) to use on the servies query as the second argument.
