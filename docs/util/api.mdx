<Note>You probably shouldn't directly use any of these. Most of them are used internally and exposed for *advanced users*.</Note>

### [async] loginAnonymously
This lets you login anonymously. It returns a response from the `auth` services command.

```js
import { loginAnonymously } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await loginAnonymously();
console.log(response);
```

This returns information about the newly created anonymous account.

Note that Firebase, the database provider of the game, ratelimits anon accounts created every hour.

### [async] loginWithCredentials
This lets you login with a specified email and password.

```js
import { loginWithCredentials } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await loginWithCredentials('email@example.com', 'ThisIsAPassword123!');
console.log(response);
```

This returns information about the account.

### [async] loginWithRefreshToken
This lets you login using a Firebase refresh token

You can learn about obtaining those by looking at the `loginWithRefreshToken` docs for the [Bot](../classes/bot).

```js
import { loginWithRefreshToken } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await loginWithRefreshToken('some-VeRy-L0ng-rAndomTexT-heRe');
console.log(response);
```

This returns information about the account.

### [async] createAccount
This allows you to create an account.

```js
import { createAccount } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await createAccount('email@example.com', 'ThisIsAPassword123!');
console.log(response);
```

It returns the same thing as "loginWithCredentials".

### [async] queryServices
This lets you directly query the `services` socket.

```js
import { queryServices } from 'yolkbot/api';

let response = await queryServices({ cmd: 'auth', firebaseToken: '...' });
console.log(response);
```

This is mostly used internally, but allows you to do things like play Chikn Winner.

### Additional Arguments
Each of these take two extra arguments at the end in the following order:

- proxy (string): A socks4 or socks5 proxy to use for the request.
- instance (string): The instance of Shell Shockers to use, default `shellshock.io`.
