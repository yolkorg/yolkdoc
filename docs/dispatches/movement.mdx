title: "MovementDispatch"
description: "Move the bot"
---

### Example Usage

```js
import MovementDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatches/MovementDispatch';
import { Movements } from 'yolkbot/constants';

bot.dispatch(new MovementDispatch(Movement.FORWARD)); // move forward
bot.dispatch(new MovementDispatch([Movement.FORWARD, Movement.LEFT])); // move forward & to the left
bot.dispatch(new MovementDispatch([Movement.FORWARD, Movement.LEFT, Movement.JUMP])); // move forward & to the left while jumping
bot.dispatch(new MovementDispatch()); // stop moving entirely
```

### Checks
- The bot must be playing the game
- The movement passed must be a valid movement
    - Movement validation is not as strict as other dispatches due to the enum format
    - Be careful to only pass valid movement patterns
    - Things like moving forward and backwards at the same time will not fail the check!

### Notes
Similar to how firing/the FireDispatch works, movement is not instantly sent. It is sent with the next `syncMe` packet. Movement is part of the `syncMe` packet, not a separate one.
