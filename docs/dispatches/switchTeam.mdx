title: "SwitchTeamDispatch"
description: "Switch the bot's team"

### Example Usage

```js
import SwitchTeamDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatches/SwitchTeamDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new SwitchTeamDispatch());
```

### Checks
- The bot must be in a game, but not playing
- The bot must not be in an FFA game
- If the room is private:
    - The host must not have disabled team switching
- If the room is public:
    - The bot must have fewer teammates than the enemies
    - This *should* end up running the same check the server does, and will never switch teams if the bot shouldn't be able it
