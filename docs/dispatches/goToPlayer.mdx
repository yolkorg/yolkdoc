title: "GoToPlayerDispatch"
description: "Pathfind to a player ingame."
---

### Example Usage

```js
import GoToPlayerDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatches/GoToPlayerDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new GoToPlayerDispatch(bot.players[0])); // the argument must be an entire "player" object
```

### Checks
- The bot must be playing
- The target must be valid and playing
- The bot must have the `PATHFINDING` intent

### Important Note
A GoToPlayerDispatch will hijack **both the looking and the movement** of the bot. This means that the bot will not be able to look around or move until it reaches the target. If you NEED TO MOVE, you can:

1. Set `bot.pathing.followingPath` to false
2. Do whatever looking/movement/whatever you want to do
3. If you HAVE NOT MOVED, just set `bot.pathing.followingPath` back to true
4. If you HAVE MOVED, you will need to create a new GoToPlayerDispatch on your target
