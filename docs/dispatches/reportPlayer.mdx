### Example Usage

```js
import ReportPlayerDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatches/ReportPlayerDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new ReportPlayerDispatch(0, {
    cheating: true,
    harassment: true,
    offensive: true,
    other: false
})); // a player's ID with the "cheating", "harassment", and "offensive" reasons selected

bot.dispatch(new ReportPlayerDispatch('playerName')); // a player's name with no reasons selected (it will select just the "other" option)
```

### Checks
- The bot must be in a game
- The player passed must be a valid player in the game

### Notes
The following options can be passed:

- `cheating`
- `harassment`
- `offensive`
- `other`

If you don't pass an option, it will be assumed that the option is not selected.

If you don't pass a reason object, it will assume reason is "other" and go through with the report.
