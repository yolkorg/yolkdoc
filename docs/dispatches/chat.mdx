description: "Send a chat message"

### Example Usage

```js
import ChatDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatches/ChatDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new ChatDispatch('message here'));
```

### Checks
- The message must be a valid string
- The message must be between 1 and 64 characters (game limit)
- The bot must be in a game and not have chatted in the last 3 seconds
    - This helps prevent ratelimits in chat.
    - If you want to disable this functionality, pass `true` as the second argument to the dispatch.
        - Example: `bot.dispatch(new ChatDispatch('message here', true));`
- If the bot is not in a private game, the account must be email verified and at least 12 hours old
    - This is because chat is disabled for unverified accounts in public games.
