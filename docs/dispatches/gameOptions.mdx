title: "GameOptionsDispatch"
description: "Change game settings in private game (where you are the host)"

### Example Usage

```js
import GameOptionsDispatch from 'yolkbot/dispatches/GameOptionsDispatch';

bot.dispatch(new GameOptionsDispatch());
```

### Dispatch Checks
- The bot must be the owner of the game
- Each of the `bot.game` options must be valid

### Changing Options
Option changing isn't handled directly through the dispatch. To change game options, modify the `bot.game.options` object through raw setting values (e.g. `bot.game.options.gravity = 0.5`). Then, call the dispatch to apply the changes.
